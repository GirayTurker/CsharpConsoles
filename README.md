# Simple Algorithm

-The algorithm will check for all desired value for "n" to "1" for with conditions down below

- If i multiple if 3 and 5, print GirayTurker
- If i is multiple of only 3, print Giray
- If i is multiple of only 5, print Turker
- if i is NOT multiple of 3 or 5, print the value of i
- Each value i in the set is is ascending order.

- To change the given value, change "n" number in Result.GirayTurker(n).
